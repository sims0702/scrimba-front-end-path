        <h1>Welcome to my first website everyone!</h1>
        <p id="intro-para">
          I am going to talk about how I am deeply struggling to get along
          lol...

          <h2>Introducing myself</h2>
          <p>
            In short... You need to have a gameplan to be able to succeed and
            make it happen.. Without having a solid gameplan to progress through
            you will keep digging inside of the tutorial hell thinking that you
            haven't learned much.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is normal, because the beauty of mastering it is practise.
            Everyone is telling you this, but in reality you don't really know
            where to begin. This is also a big big problem I have encountered
            myself!
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why I started to take the front-end web development course
            from Simba so that I am able to get this done once for all. In my
            opinion... as I look at the content and the interactivity of this
            amazing site and its conents.. it is simply amazing to learn web
            development. You have it all inside of one User Interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alhough... I do think that the setup of your project will be kind of
            difficult to do on your own. That is what you will need to search in
            youtube yourself.
          </p>
          <p>Next I am going to talk about what my Gameplan is going to be.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-content">
          <h2>My Gameplan</h2>
          <p>Today, I decided to cut all the crap and just go for it!</p>
          <p>
            As a first... I am going to take the front-end development path from
            Scrimba to be able to lift up my front-end web development skills
            after which I am going to transition to the back-end to be able to
            create
            <strong>Web Application</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not immediately though... Before making the transition I am going to
            craft a couple of pages or even clone some websites without viewing
            their source code, because this way I am going to learn much more
            than just watching a course!
          </p>
          <p>
            As a matter a fact... I am going to sum up my path by using a
            numbered list so that it is easier to track and wlll look
            <em>cleaner</em> to the eye.
          </p>
          <h3>How I am going to approach my web development journey</h3>
          <p>
            The main goal is to learn
            <strong>
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby and the back-end framework for
              ruby, Rails </strong
            >. At least... This is all of it for now...
          </p>
          <ol class="path">
            <li>
              <h4>
                1. Scrimba front-end developer path
                <span class="language">(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</span>
              </h4>
              <p>
                I will be taking the Scrimba Front-end development path to
                evolve my front-end skills, so that I am confident to make an
                amazing and beautiful website. There is also a project to create
                a Netflix clone which will certainly be amazing.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>2. Create a couple of websites</h4>
              <p>
                I am going to craft a couple of websites to reinforce what I
                have learned about the front-end technologies.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="break">

                <span class="language">(Ruby)</span>
              </h4>
              <p>
                In this phase, I am going to learn the back-end to be able to
                make fully-fledged web-application where my
                <em>imagination</em> will be the only thing that stands between
                me and
                <strong>changing the world!</strong>
